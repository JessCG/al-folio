%    In both the Fall and Winter terms, I completed courses relevant to my program (\textsl{see transcript}) and planned my experimental work. Since April 2012, we have been collecting sediment cores biweekly on a tidal flat in the Bay of Fundy, and field work is anticipated to last until November 2012. I have been eroding the cores collected using a Gust erosion microcosm, obtaining grain size distributions of the eroded sediment, and preserving surface samples for future analysis (pigments and extracellular polymeric substances). During this time, I also provided input into two Honours' projects. \vspace{-0.6mm}

%        \textsl{Student recruitment (volunteer)} \hfill \textbf{Sept. 2011 - Feb. 2012} \vspace{1mm}\\
% 	I contributed to the creation and editing of a brochure for the Dalhousie Oceanography department, gave an interview for the departmental website, and created a powerpoint presentation used by the department for student recruitment at the AGU Fall Meeting (December 2011), Dalhousie University Academic Program Fair (January 2012) and Ocean Sciences Meeting (February 2012). I also attended the AGU meeting as a departmental representative to provide information at the booth, and volunteered shifts at both our university fair and OSM.\vspace{-0.6mm}
%
%   \textsl{Honours project with Professor Paul S. Hill} \hfill \textbf{May 2010 - Aug. 2011}\vspace{1mm}\\
%    For my Honours research project, I studied the effects of biofilms on sediment erosion. I designed my own experiments and field work schedule. We collected core samples biweekly during summer 2010, which I eroded using a Gust erosion microcosm. I then obtained grain size distributions using a Multisizer III Coulter Counter, and chlorophyll \textsl{a} measurements using a fluorometer. A manuscript for this work has been submitted to Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. \vspace{-0.6mm}
%
%    \textsl{Research assistant for Professor Paul S. Hill} \hfill \textbf{May 2009 - May 2010}\vspace{1mm}\\
%    During this time, I collected sediment samples from a mud flat in Willapa Bay (Washington State), eroded cores, and obtained grain size distributions with a Multisizer II Coulter Counter. I also worked to transfer our data collection to a Multisizer III Coulter Counter and developed a procedure which is currently in use by local sediment research laboratories. I am still regularly training students and outside technicians to use this procedure.
