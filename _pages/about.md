I am best described as an outdoorsy nerd. I enjoy field work and climbing, as well as puzzles, quantitative problems, and models. My research interests focus on small-scale physical-biological interactions in the ocean, especially their implications for transport of plankton or sediment. With a team at Rutgers University and the University of Maine, I am currently investigating how larval responses to flow conditions affect their transport throughout Delaware Bay and the Mid-Atlantic Bight. 

For my PhD, I investigated internal wave transport by deploying a swarm of planktonic robots, [the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorers](http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/research-projects/autonomous-underwater-explorers/){:target="\_blank"}, built by the Jaffe Laboratory for Underwater Imaging at Scripps Oceanography. Before my PhD, I completed a BSc and MSc at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Some of my work investigated how biofilms influence sediment erosion on intertidal flats in the Bay of Fundy. With 10-m tides, we had to time it right!

I am very passionate about making programming, math, and science more useful and enjoyable for everyone. Feel free to use any of the [code](/code/) I developed and reach out to me if you have questions. Among others, you will find introductory material to R for oceanographers, from a class I developed and taught with [Eiren Jacobson](https://eirenjacobson.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, as well as outreach activities to learn programming for projects with the [Ocean Discovery Institute](http://oceandiscoveryinstitute.org/){:target="\_blank"} and the [United World Challenge](https://unitedworldchallenge.org/){:target="\_blank"}.
