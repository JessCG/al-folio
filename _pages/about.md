I am best described as an outdoorsy nerd. I enjoy field work and climbing, as well as puzzles, quantitative problems, and models. My research interests focus on physical-biological interactions in the ocean, especially their implications for transport of plankton or sediment. To look into internal wave transport, I deployed a swarm of planktonic robots, [the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorers](http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/research-projects/autonomous-underwater-explorers/){:target="\_blank"}, built by the Jaffe Laboratory for Underwater Imaging, and supplemented their measurements with models. Stay tuned for upcoming [publications](/publications/)!

Before starting at SIO, I completed a BSc and MSc at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Some of my work investigated how biofilms influence sediment erosion on intertidal flats in the Bay of Fundy. With 10-m tides, we had to time it right!

I am very passionate about making programming, math, and science more useful and enjoyable for everyone. Feel free to use any of the [code](/code/) I developed and reach out to me if you have questions. Among others, you will find introductory material to R for oceanographers, from a class I developed and taught with [Eiren Jacobson](https://eirenjacobson.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, as well as outreach activities to learn programming and analyze wave data for a project with the [Ocean Discovery Institute](http://oceandiscoveryinstitute.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Beside time spent on my PhD and outreach, I dedicate a few hours working at my campus climbing gym, the [Outback Climbing Center](https://recreation.ucsd.edu/adventures/climbing-center/){:target="\_blank"}, as well as volunteering with the [Banff Centre Mountain Film + Book Festival](https://www.banffcentre.ca/banff-mountain-film-book-festival){:target="\_blank"}. I am community-oriented, enjoy introducing people to my passions, and have lots of energy!
