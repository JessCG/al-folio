#### [research project with middle and high school students](https://github.com/JessCG/Outreach_CodingAndWaves){:target="\_blank"}
Every year, San Diegoâ€™s [Ocean Discovery Institute](http://oceandiscoveryinstitute.org/){:target="\_blank"} partners with one local ocean scientist to develop a year-long research project for a group of low income, middle school students. Inspired by a [*Wired* article](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/){:target="\_blank"}, I decided to center our project on coding so the students could develop additional hireable skills. The [10+ coding activities](https://github.com/JessCG/Outreach_CodingAndWaves){:target="\_blank"} in R can be used to introduce programming, mathematical concepts, Cartesian coordinates, as well as ocean data analysis using waves generated in a tank. If you are not familiar with GitHub, start with the ReadMe. 

#### [intro to R for oceanographers](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-to-R-for-Oceanographers){:target="\_blank"}

In spring 2015, Eiren Jacobson and I developed and taught a graduate-level introduction to R at SIO. The [course material](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-to-R-for-Oceanographers){:target="\_blank"} was recently made available online. Students and instructors will find 9 weeks of activities ranging from introducing basic programming skills (*if statements, for loops*) and libraries (*ggplot2, oce*) to binning CTD data and more. 


#### [merging grain size distributions](https://github.com/JessCG/MS3){:target="\_blank"}

One of my first experiences with sharing code was during my Master's degree when I modified a Matlab code developed by John Newgard to be an easily downloaded and set up package, compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems. The [code](https://github.com/JessCG/MS3){:target="\_blank"} is still downloaded by various users to merge grain size distributions obtained with a Beckman Coulter Multisizer 3.
