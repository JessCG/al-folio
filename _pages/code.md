#### [intro to R for oceanographers](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-to-R-for-Oceanographers){:target="\_blank"}

In spring 2015, Eiren Jacobson and I developed and taught a graduate-level introduction to R at SIO. The [course material](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-to-R-for-Oceanographers){:target="\_blank"} was recently made available online. Students and instructors will find 9 weeks of activities ranging from introducing basic programming skills (*if statements, for loops*) and libraries (*ggplot2, oce*) to binning CTD data and more. 


#### [merging grain size distributions](https://github.com/JessCG/MS3){:target="\_blank"}

One of my first experience with sharing code was during my Master's degree when I modified a Matlab code developed by John Newgard to be compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems. The [code](https://github.com/JessCG/MS3){:target="\_blank"} is still downloaded by various users to merge grain size distributions obtained with a Beckman Coulter Multisizer 3.
